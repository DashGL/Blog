# DashGL Services

After a pretty hectic year, I've had a chance to get back into spending time
on DashGL stuff. During this process I've started to end up with several 
services that I need to take a step back and focus on what's what. 

## Video

## Social Media

- Twitter
- Mastodon
- Reddit

## Funding

- Patreon
- Ko-fi
- Liberapay

## Source Code

- Github

## Documentation

## Blog

- Hackmd.io

## Email / DNS

- Namecheap

## Planning 

- Jira
- Diagrams.net 


Some thoughts and notes about where and how these services are set up. 
One issue is the balance between Patreon, Ko-fi and Liberapay. These
are three websites that are hard to keep up-to-date with blogs and to
get information back from posts on these websites. Not sure if there
is a service to aggregate these, or if it's something that I need to
develop better dicipline around.

The next issue I've been having is with source control. In general I
would put emphasis on the more FOSS option, which is Gitlab in this
case. But one thing that's hard to ignore is the amount of reach
that Github has. I think the way that I want to separate these is
what each one of these is used for. 

I have a Github organization for DashGL. I should probably use this 
for anything that get's "published". The scope of what get's published
here would be the Gatsby homepage, these blogs, tutorials and tools.

For Gitlab and my personal Gitlab account, I have two options. Right
now I've been using Gitlab as a way to develop and test tools for games.
I should probably clear what I have for web hosting, and move those
to Github.

For my personal account on Github, Ive been using it for tutorials.
I've bene trying to separate a "work" Github account and my DashGL
Github account so that my personal account doesn't get flooded with
activity that doesn't matter. But I think I might switch to using
_kion-dgl_ as my primary account for everything, and then move anything
specific into the DashGL organization for separation. 

Otherwise what remeains here isn't too bad. Really tempted to make a
portal page for tracking all of these services to be able to access
them quickly.

Something like this would allow me to set monthly goals, track
progress, and then keep on top of all of the services that I use
on a regular basis. And would also help me in the case that any
of these services had a monthly subscription or expiration. And
I would also like to see badges for notifcations and messages. 

My other issue would how I set up my devices to be able to focus
on a specific task. I would prefer to have one computer for
work and one computer for open source and be able to switch
in between these. But there's also something to be said about
being able to jump between them to be able to jump in and
do open source stuff whenever I have the oppertunity. That will
need to be its own blog post.

But this blog post was helpful in helping me reflect on how I can
set up and organize DashGL in terms of which services and how 
I publish information and keep on top on notifications.
